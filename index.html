    <p>In May 2012, Adult Swim unveiled its development slate that included a <i>Rick and Morty</i> <a
        href="/wiki/Television_pilot" title="Television pilot">pilot</a> from Harmon and Roiland,<sup id="cite_ref-11"
        class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup> which was eventually picked up to series in October
      2012,
      as one of the network's first primetime original shows.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup> The first season premiered in December 2013 and concluded in April 2014.
      It
      comprised eleven episodes (including the pilot), and aired Mondays at 10:30 pm <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"
        title="Eastern Time Zone">ET</a>/<a href="/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone" title="Pacific Time Zone">PT</a>.<sup
        id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>Two months earlier, in February 2014, the show had been renewed for a second season, with the press release
      noting
      that <i>Rick and Morty</i> consistently outperformed direct competition in its time slot.<sup id="cite_ref-14"
        class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[13]</a></sup> Season two aired Sundays at 11:30 pm ET/PT, from July
      to
      October 2015, and comprised ten episodes.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-15">[14]</a></sup> In an interview with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter"
          title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>, Roiland said that <i>Rick and Morty</i> will
      remain
      "a big priority above anything else" for him in the future, and expressed his intention to keep the show
      growing.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[15]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>Adult Swim renewed <i>Rick and Morty</i> for a third season in August 2015, shortly after a successful
      second-season
      premiere.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup> The two co-creators and
      executive producers expressed their delight at the series' popularity.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> The season premiered unannounced on April 1, 2017, as part of an <a
        href="/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" title="April Fools' Day">April Fools'</a> prank. The remaining episodes began
      airing
      weekly almost four months later, continuing in the same time slot from season two, and the initial airing
      concluded in
      October 2017.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup> Although it was
      originally
      intended for the season to consist of fourteen episodes, as a result of production delays it eventually comprised
      only
      ten.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>Following the conclusion of the show's third season, co-creators Harmon and Roiland wanted to have assurance that
      there would be many more seasons of <i>Rick and Morty</i> in the future, so that they would be able to focus on
      the
      show and minimize their involvement in other projects.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> Additionally, Harmon had expressed his wish for the upcoming fourth season
      to
      consist of more than ten episodes.<sup id="cite_ref-HarmonSeason4_22-0" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-HarmonSeason4-22">[21]</a></sup> In May 2018, after prolonged contract negotiations, Adult
      Swim
      announced a long-term deal with the creators, ordering 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.<sup
        id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup> Roiland was confident that this big
      renewal deal will allow the creators to minimize the gaps between seasons, as they will be able to schedule their
      time
      around the show and "keep the machine going."<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>In May 2019, the fourth season of <i>Rick and Morty</i> was announced to debut in November 2019.<sup
        id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> The fourth season consisted of ten
      episodes split across
      two airings.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup> The first five episodes
      began airing on November 10, 2019,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[26]</a></sup>
      while
      the remaining five episodes began airing on May 3, 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a
          href="#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup>
